# SAM_SCM_Classifier
Hyper-Spectral Image Classifier in C++ using SAM and SCM

○ Carried out project on ‘Hyperspectral Image Classification using SAM and SCM with Parallel 
Implementation’.

○ Implemented Spectral Angle Mapper and Spectral Correlation Mapper classification algorithms 
for thematic mapping of hyperspectral images in C++.

○ Also implemented multithreading on these algorithms and performed a comparative speed up 
study according to the number of threads
